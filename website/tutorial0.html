text and the following tutorial
documents are intended to help guide anyone interested in the
possibilities of rB+. This first one will to give a brief, simplified
and friendly picture of what the Jaguar is and how rB+ might allow you
to get creative and productive with your console. Rather than a
tutorial discussing how to program in BASIC, subsequent parts will
cover more of the raptor-specific side of rB+, the general flow and
organisation of a project, and a simple background to how it all comes
together as software on your Jaguar or Virtual Jaguar.<br>
      <br>
DISCLAIMER: This isn't a technical document. Further episodes are
likely to remain as equally devoid of technical facts and figures. It
exists solely to help put people in the right frame of mind regarding
the workings of the Jaguar, raptor and rB+. To achieve this, it
over-simplifies quite liberally to keep things in a comfortably safe
realm that parallels the very reason for rB+'s existence.<br>
      <br>
raptor BASIC plus - rB+ - is Reboot's most recent attempt to lower the
bar for would-be developers, to break down yet more barriers preventing
people becoming active on the open platform Jaguar. It is built on the
technology that was created to form raptor. Throughout the years of
Jaguar's homebrew infancy and all the way through to today, many people
have contributed to the Jaguar cause by releasing their libraries,
discovering tricks and tips and sharing their knowledge. Now things
take a slightly different turn - this is finally it, thanks to all that
came before, we're now at the point where anyone and everyone gets to
give it a go... where creativity and flair are given the chance to
one-up past efforts as a broader spectrum of designers, tinkerers and
curious kids with a few spare hours finally get to participate without
having to do all the homework.<br>
      <br>
At least, that would be the case in an ideal world. As things stand
there's a rather large barrier preventing much of this - documentation.
That's something I plan to address with this website and a series of
tutorials and mini features. What you are reading now is part zero.
This is where we get things correctly aligned in our heads before we
type a single line of code or define our first sprite.<br>
      <br>
So that's rB+ - what actually is raptor?<br>
      <br>
raptor is CJ's hardware-abstracting package designed to take much of
the grind out of game development on Jaguar, to keep developers busy
with more of the fun aspects of making games rather than lost in
technicalities and reinventing the wheel each time a new project is
undertaken. rB+ is the vehicle for placing this power into the hands of
a broader user-base: raptor for all.<br>
      <br>
If you're new to Jaguar or, like myself, have only a passing knowledge
of the hardware specifics, this text will hopefully prove helpful in
getting you thinking the "Jaguar way" and similarly the "raptor way"
and remove any lingering fears after downloading the package and being
presented with all those scary .S files and only the fairly technical
raptor manual for company (designed for assembler coders, not BASIC
programmers). This is where we get past all that and break down any
misconceptions we might have and build a clear and simple picture of
the framework we'll work within.<br>
      <br>
I'm hopefully assuming nothing here. You may be familiar with creating
games on other platforms, in BASIC or more low-level languages, if so
you likely have a greater understanding of game creation than myself.
OTOH, you could just be an avid Jaguar fan who has never even
considered how to make a game but have spied the potential opportunity
to dip a toe into Jaguar programming, something you might never have
expected. Wherever you sit along that line, hopefully you'll shortly be
in a better position and feel confident to give it a go. A few minutes
from now you'll be able to begin thinking how rB+ can allow you to
explore your creative ideas and realise them as software running on the
machine.</span><small><br>

So what we're going to concentrate on first is the way the Jaguar
builds the display we see on our TVs. This is fundamental and something
we need to get right before going any further. We often read about how
powerful the Jaguar is for 2D games, but do we know why this is so? It
constructs the display we see with the use of its powerful 64-bit
Object Processor (OP), but this processor is not one we have to
directly program, it basically just digests a listed description of
what we want to see on screen and constructs it. You could think of it
as reading blueprint of what we want to see, seeing a list of the
building blocks and where to find them, and then going off to build it
for us. The blueprint is the Object List; the building blocks are
objects or, as we'll be referring to them because it's friendlier,
sprites, and the display on screen is nothing more than a collage of
these sprites. Oddly, that collage is not something that actually ever
exists as a whole...<br>
      <br>
Instead of having dedicated video memory, somewhere we copy all these
sprites to in order to create the whole scene, Jaguar produces the
display a single line at a time, up to 50 or 60 times a second for
every row of pixels that form our view on screen. Working this way,
Jaguar only ever has to think about just those sprites involved in
building a single row of pixels, line by line. That's worth giving some
thought, so maybe it's a good time to go make a hot, strong cup of
something and consider what implications that might have. Get the cogs
turning the right way.<br>
      <br>
If you went for that drink, hopefully you're already thinking of some
of the advantages to this method of managing the display and maybe even
a potential problem or two that might arise. If you've realised that a
single block of graphics data in memory can be used to describe any
number of objects or sprites on screen without using any more memory,
good work. That's obviously something rB+ lets you take full advantage
of. You could have a single sprite or 50 sprites over an empty
background, all based on the same block of graphics in RAM, both
effectively being equal in terms of memory usage - just one sprite's
worth. If you're worriedly considering how the OP might handle all 50
of these objects on one line at a time, your concern is noted. However,
Jaguar is powerful and you'll come to get a feel for what is and what
is not possible as your experience grows. Half the fun is finding out
the limits of what you can get away with and tricks to get around the
problems.<br>
      <br>
Jaguar's object handling allows for a little code and some simple list
scripting to be translated into often quite complex scenes and
movements on screen, that's all thanks to the OP. raptor has it's own
lists that mirror these OP lists and manages them in the background.
rB+ allows simple but powerful manipulation of these raptor lists that
describe the objects we see. There's nothing particularly difficult
about setting up the lists, in fact it's just like filling in a form.
Each list is made up of a series of standard sprite definitions. These
definitions are nothing more than a series of properties that combine
to describe a sprite's look and movements - such as number of colours,
size, position on screen, and also automated properties that tick over
in the background without programmer intervention such as animation and
drift. There are also standard Jaguar features such as scaling,
horizontal flipping and windowing on larger bitmaps, made possible just
by defining or re-defining a sprite's properties. It's simple but
powerful stuff.<br>
      <br>
Now we're getting a feel for how the Jaguar does its 2D magic, it's
maybe time to take a look at a single raptor/rB+ sprite definition and
examine the majority of the properties. I had considered not touching
on any of this stuff just yet, but I think it would help give more of a
flavour of the possibilities and demystify things further if we do this
now. A raptor list is nothing more than a series of these sprite
definitions with a few markers here and there to allow raptor to manage
them appropriately. The most potentially troublesome thing, and I
believe this is why some people instantly baulked at the idea of rB+ as
"requires assembler knowledge" (absolutely, categorically untrue) is
that the list itself is contained in a hideously terrifying .S file.<br>
      </span><span style="font-family: monospace;"><br>
An .S file!<br>
      <br>
Oh no! That must mean it's difficult, right? Well... in all fairness,
it can and does look a little daunting the first time you come face to
face with it. But there is really nothing to fear, as I said, it's just
a blank form that is hungry for our numbers. Let's take a look at a
pseudo-entry converted to slightly friendlier English. Everything here
is directly comparable to an actual sprite definition.<br>

      <span style="font-family: monospace;">And that's pretty much all
there is to it. A raptor list essentially
just consists of a number of entries like the one above. Most entries
in there can be directly tinkered with from within rB+ once your
program is up and running, and this is how the game creation begins. In
reality it's slightly more involved and requires a little more
understanding of different types of numbers and how they are used, but
nothing that a little experimentation won't easily put to bed. It'll
all make even more sense in the next part when we put this into
practise and actually begin making things happen on screen. Until then,
read through the sprite definition a couple more times and familiarise
yourself with the properties and consider how you might modify those
properties to make wonderful things happen on screen :0)</span><br>
