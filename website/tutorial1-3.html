That's
it for this look at the actual "Doger" BASIC program. As we looked
briefly at
a possible game creation flow, it might be worth
thinking about what parts of that you want to adopt to form something
that suits you. I'll recap below:<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Imagine concept<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Create rough game play flow description.
Refine each step into more
detailed sub-steps if it helps think things through,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; especially if the
game has complexities.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Create suitable assets<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Define sprites, sounds and music etc. based on
these assets<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set up .BAS file with variables matching the
sprites<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Complete a fully refined game flow breakdown
and implement as BASIC code<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Iron out the bugs<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unleash on the masses<br>
      </small> <br>
How you actually do any of that is entirely up to you, these are merely
suggestions from one novice to another. If
you wish to chat about any of this, feel free to contact me via

W<span style="font-weight: bold;">here could this tutorial game go from
this point?</span><br>
      <br>
There's
much that could be added to make the game better at this point.
It functions, there are no real game-breaking glitches or bugs, but
it's hardly got the flair and polish that makes the game the finished
article, but that was never the intention. It exists merely to help you
get your head around making games with rB+. I'll likely work on Doger
some more or see if it can be used as
further material for further tutorials. Maybe you could attempt some
of these yourself or come up with some of your own? <br>
      <br>
&nbsp;<small>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give the Doge a number of
lives
and end the game if he dies too often.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have an extra life pick-up or
bonus points pick-up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You could keep a score of the
Doges that make it home.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use a timer to give bonuses for
faster traversal of the game screen.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have a multiplier based on
survival rate.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Implement a sinking/rising raft,
more like the original game this one goes part way to mimicking.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adjust the raft traversal rates
and initial positions via rapinit.s - as is they are far from ideal or
fun to play.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Increase the fractional speed of
game elements and a game level system that takes advantage of them -
very simple<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; difficulty/level progression.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Animate the water area.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Create some animation frames for
the doges at the top - dancing doges?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Change all graphics, give the
game your own look and feel.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compose some ProTracker MOD music
of your own and record your own sound effects.</small><br>
      <br>
If you're feeling even more adventurous and wish to explore rB+ on your
own without further guidance:<br>
      <br>
      <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Implement further
raptor lists
for a real menu screen, results screen and high scores table.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Implement high score saving and
loading via
Memory Track.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Create some RMW nyan trail
animations and track the nyancats with them.<br>
      </small> <br>
There's plenty more to consider, that's the beauty of these old
classics, they're often ripe for a few additional gameplay twists or a
touch of modernising, yet they still hold their own as fun little
games. I hope this tutorial has helped you get a leg up the rB+ ladder.
Once you've got the major concepts and a feel for the flow, there's not
a lot holding you back other than yourself, so go create!<br>
