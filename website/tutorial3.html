      <span style="font-weight: bold;">LOLVALAMP project</span><br>
      <br>
Extract the ZIP file to your PROJECTS folder and you'll get the
"lolvalamp"
project. In this micro tutorial, we're simply going to mix and match
video modes, object types and "stuff". There's really nothing more to
it, but you might just find the tiny amount of "code" to be a bit of an
eye-opener.<br>
      <br>
We're using the "lolvalamp" screen from the Cloudy With a Chance of
Metaballs rB+ demo in order to highlight the kind of fun you can have
when doing things that maybe you're not meant to. There isn't really
any code required to have the Jaguar produce the lolvalamp effect, it's
all Raptor and the OP doing their thing - the only real work on our end
is creating suitable assets (the blobs in this case) and setting up the
video mode and object definitions a certain way, then letting raptor
take things from there.<br>
      <br>
Here is an example of one of the blobs:<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 128px; height: 128px;" alt="128x128 blob" src="images/blob128.png"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
It's a 16-bit RGB (RBG for Jaguar), boring, grey, murky 128x128 shaded
circle and quite a blurry one at that. The brightest pixel used here is
55,55,55, or #373737 if you're that way inclined. The RGB source gfx
were converted to CRY format using ZeroSquare's nodither tool. The
object to make use of it had this as part of its declaration:<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dc.l&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">is_cry</span></span>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="font-family: monospace;">;
(CRY/RGB)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ; bitmap </span><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">GFX
type</span></span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dc.l&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">is_trans</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;
(TRANSPARENCY)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ; bitmap TRANS flag<br>
      <br>
Nothing too interesting there. We have our CRY object, but we're not
going to use a matching video mode. Where the fun comes in and we get
the free <span style="font-style: italic;">metaball-ish</span>
effect (not
really, but whatevs) is when use an RGB video mode, CRY objects and
carefully set a background colour allowing the weird to happen.<br>
      <br>
Before you first build the project, head to line 21 and change the
video mode to "cry_voff" instead of "rgb_voff". Build that and you'll
see the kind of thing
that was being played around with initially -
hoping to have them interact and saturate out to the top end as more
piled on, it's a bit meh but it was only an experiment (see the clouds
in the Reboot game "Kobayashi Maru" for an example). there's still some
fun you could play with there with a few object types, some sort of
fake DOF effect for distant lights or something. Anyway, once you're
done and have viewed that, change it back to "rgb_voff", build the
project once more, and you'll see
something more like the CWaCoM screen.<br>
      <br>
So there's an
array of blobs floating around aimlessly, melting into one another
as they pass by. There are around 12 or 13 128x128x16bit rmw
objects(!), 6 64x64x16bit animated objects and just a couple of the
small
32x32x16bit animated objects. Animation of the 128x128s was removed for
this demo as it clashed with BG changes (the frames are still there if
you wish to reactivate them in rapinit.s, read on for info on BG
changes).<br>
      <br>
You might notice the Object Processor grind a little if you leave it
running long enough - nothing here is scripted or planned, it's let
loose on rapinit object presets for the purposes of the demonstration.
So if you notice tearing
when lots of stuff is sat on the same scanline, you've now been blessed
with a taste of what an overloaded OP looks like.<br>
      <br>
What's
fun here in this RGB video mode vs the
CRY one, is instead of the colours saturating at the high end, they
look to clip
and appear to loop back around, and that effect looks sort of
psychedelic and interesting. The other interesting thing is the objects
appear to melt into each other in their "halo" regions as long as the
background colour allows for it. There's also the result of brighter
spots looping again and creating a kind of topography effect, all quite
fun and "free" in hardware.<br>
      <br>
You'll notice in the demo that the background
colour changes from bright yellow to deep red and back over time, this
is merely to help demonstrate how inter-object interactivity alters
within the larger range. When the background is bright yellow, you'll
see the objects saturate out to deep red at the edges and brighter
orange in the centre. When the backdrop is deep red, the objects appear
as small red blobs with huge yellow halos. At both extremes, the range
of the halo region inter-object melting is reduced and can produce some
odd artifacting, but it can also offer some weirder-in-a-good-way
results -
try using some static values instead of allowing cola to be used to
alter the value every 5 frames. You could also try altering the BG in a
more sensible way than just adding and subtracting 1 to it as that's
just daft when you think what you're actually doing outside the safety
of the range of greens you are affecting, lol.<br>
      <br>
Now try changing line 38 to have a larger range of values - 254:<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IF cola=59646 OR cola=59392 THEN<br>
      <br>
Some more odd stuff occurs out in the further reaches where everything
saturates out to yellow as more blue is added, it appears as a kind of
mixture of clipping then saturating... someone good with numbers could
explain that and make some better use of it, but
quite what use this kind of stuff could be beyond demo-ish
screens is any body's guess. But regardless, have a play around, pile
them high and move
your objects in more regular and scripted ways, the results can be
really fun! Try all kinds of source graphics with different ranges of
shading and mix them in with others, see how they interact. If you want
to get really trip-o-tronic, switch varmod on (change vmode to cry_von)
and add the 128x128 animation back in (set maxframe on each to 5 in
rapinit). Play around with that range of background values... there's
likely much more potential for demo-ish/game effects using these
properties of the Jaguar. [SPOILER] Full disclosure, the seed of an
idea has been planted to try to produce a stylish (lol?) shmupish type
thing somehow taking advantage of the free eye-torture psychedelia. 60
frames, brixxels and lolvalamp fx just seems rude to ignore but
frightening to explore. Either
that or some oddball physics game... or maybe a Tactical RoleBlobbing
Blob or... blobby blobby blobblob... [/SPOILER]<br>
