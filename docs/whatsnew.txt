- Fixed graphics importer for the case of 16bit bmp file. Thanks to Saboteur for bringing this up
- Added project background that demonstrates transparent text over 4 different backgrounds
- New command hiscore_sort(table) which sorts tables 0 to 4. Also changed functionality of hiscore_check to hiscore_check(score,name$,table) so it can check tables 0 to 4.
- Added project scoresadvanced that demonstrates the new multiple hiscore tables functionality.
- New raptor.o with multiple score tables. 5 scores tables are supported now.
- Fixed peek() to not issue compiler errors. Also made str$ also compile ok (although it does not function properly)
- Added new project "drawmap" that shows how to store maps in rb+ and draw them to a playfield object from a tile map bitmap object.
- New helper macros xdivs(a,b), xdivu(a,b) will divide a by b (signed or unsigned). Notice that a should be 32bit, b 16bit and the result also 16bit. New helper macros xmuls(a,b), xmulu(a,b) will multiply a with b (signed or unsigned). a and b are 16bit and the result 32bit.
- New rlist members: x_, y_, xadd_, yadd_. These let the programmer access the integer part of the coordinates, so shifting left by 16 is not necessary. Project nyandodge updated to demonstrate this.
- New command powablitlist(pointer_to_blitlist). pointer_to_blitlist contains an array of ints that have A1_BASE, A1_FLAGS, A1_CLIP, A1_PIXEL, A1_STEP_INT, A1_STEP_FRAC, A1_PIXEL_POINTER, A1_INC_INT, A1_INC_FRACT, A2_BASE, A2_FLAGS, A2_PIXEL, A2_STEP, B_COUNT, B_PATD. Terminate the list with a 32bit zero.
- Made all build.bat commands case insensitive.
- Added symbol map output in the build log file.
- Fixed command bcx's SPLIT command.
- Added CLEAN (deletes build folder) and BOSSMODE (skips running VJ at the end of the build) for build.bat.
- Added UNPACKED switch when building a ROM, which skips packing of the rb+ binary.
- Fixed plot() yet again.
- Updated Zerosquare's audio engine to version 19-Sep-2016.
- New example project imagescroller demonstrates a scrolling background.
- New function: powaeeprom(readwrite, buffer) will read from the EEPROM to the address that buffer points if readwrite is 1 and will write to the EEPROM if readwrite is 0. 
- Extended definition of raptor_highscores_hex to include user saved data (indices 31 to 127). Project scores updated to demonstrate this.
- Fix build.bat usage information text.
- Force embedding basic source code into generated C files for easier debugging.
- Fix for buildlink opening bmp files for read/write - this will fail with read only files.

v1.3 - 25 Dec 2015
- New example project blitline demonstrates using powablitlist to draw horizontal lines.
- New command powablitlist(pointer_to_blitlist). pointer_to_blitlist contains an array of ints that have a1_base,a1_flags,a1_pixel,a2_base,a2_pixel,a2_flags,b_count,b_patd,b_cmd.
- New raptor variable exposed: raptor_blitter_use controls blitter usage in raptor (internally). 0=auto, 1=force blitter, 2=blitter disable
- Added new project rotary that demonstrates rotary control with Zerosquare's player. Thanks to OMF for this.
- Buildlink will now delete the cached files in the build folder if assets.txt is newer than any single generated file. Hopefully this will take care of old or wrongly produced cached files.
- Converted all tabs to spaces in .bas files so they can be compiled under wine on linux (and other platforms). For some reason the rb+ compiler was mangling tabs. Thanks to Christos for reporting this fix!
- Added new project pack that demonstrates how packing and unpacking resources works. Thanks to OMF for this.
- Added WORD, BYTE, UWORD, UBYTE types (use caps to access them for now)
- Fixed a long standing bug in RPRINT: essentially basic_r_size and basic_r_indx were swapped. Many thanks to OMF for the fix!
- Fixed a small bug when importing generic assets ("_end" label was not exported).
- Introduced an alternative to rsetobj/rgetobj: users can now do rlist[object].index=value instead of rsetobj and myval=rlist[object].index which is faster in execution too.
  Updated nyandodge to demonstrate the new feature.
- Project chessboard added.
- New function: rbsort(table,no_of_indices) will sort an array of longwords from smallest to largest. Only longwords (4 byte integers) for now.
- BUILD.bat now outputs build.log to console in case of error instead of opening notepad. Also fixed a bug in BUILD.bat that would continue the build process in abs mode if linking failed.
- Added a quick reference guide (incomplete).
- Fixed the stock fonts in all projects
- Assets can now be packed. Suffix field C with "_pack" in assets.txt
- New command powaunpack(source_address,destination_address) will unpack data from source_address to destination_address. Note that it's your responsibility to reserve enough RAM for unpacking. Also, no checking to see if a packed asset exists at the source address - again it's your responsibility!
- Small fix for buildlink with monochrome bmps less than 32 pixels wide.
- Bug fix for Zerosquare player rotary/mouse mode. Also, the correct way to initialise rotary/mouse mode and read inputs is:
  call Input_SetRotaryMode    'or Input_SetAtariMouseMode or Input_SetAmigaMouseMode
  call Input_SetJoyPort1           'or Input_SetJoyPort2, depending on which port the spinny device is plugged in.
  "call" is mandatory.
- Updated website files with new tutorials
- Put a hard size limit when building .abs files.
- Mention of sfx_mlaw in prototype assets.txt.
- New project raycaster.
- Moved some files from BIN to bin 
- U-235 is now again the default sound player in template.
- New commands:
  powabset(spr_index, offset, no_of_times, array_of_values, skip_offset)
  powabdiff(spr_index, offset, no_of_times, array_of_values, skip_offset)
  powabzap(spr_index, offset, no_of_times, value, skip_offset)
  Exactly the same as powaset, powadiff, powazap but you can control the offset to skip to the next object (it's hardcoded to 188 for the other three)
- New command powazap(spr_index, offset, no_of_times, value) will write value no_of_times times in offset offset, starting with index spr_index.
- New project maprunner generates a random maze and lets you scroll through it.
- New RAPTOR.O fixes a small bug with object wrapping.
- BUILD.bat ascii logo. Fix for nppexec macros (thanks to OMF!).
- powadiff(spr_index, offset, no_of_times, array_of_values)
- powaset(spr_index, offset, no_of_times, array_of_values) 
- Fixed rapapp.s files that should have changed for v1.2

v1.2 - 23 Aug 2015 - (please read carefully as it might break current projects)
- Small fix for peek/dpeek/lpeek
- Small fix for BUILD.bat
- Added our own version of jcp.exe
- Added Zerosquare's version of bjl uploader
- Small fix in build.bat that would create a folder for a non existing project
- Small fix in build.bat when building .abs files
- New option for build.bat: build <project> sendy bjl will upload built binary using bjl transfer (note: you might need to edit the upload settings)
- New file externs.inc added instead of having to .extern all new needed exposed functions. All existing rapapp.s files need some modifying!
- New function: bin2asc(number, digits, string$) will convert number with (digits+1) digits very fast and render it to string$. Note that the number has to be an integer. Quick example: bin2asc(987,2,out$) will convert number 987 to string using 3 digits and place it into out$. If we used 3 instead of 2 we'd get "0987"
- Added a new audio player by Zerosquare/CSVD. This change CAN break your builds if you don't add a few changes to your rapapp.s - see what's changed to include\template\rapapp.s for more info). You can still use the u-235 sound engine instead of this, but you have to change the first equate at the top of your rapapp.s (again, look at the template for more info).
- New command added: ZEROPAD() will read both pad ports and sends results back to variables zero_left_pad, zero_right_pad, zero_mousex_delta, zero_mousey_delta and zero_rotary_delta. By default the engine is configured to assume 2 joypads connected.
- New command added: Input_SetNormalPadMode will set up the engine to read two pads (enabled by default). zero_left_pad and zero_right_pad can be read using these constants: Input_Pad_Pause, Input_Pad_A, Input_Pad_Up, Input_Pad_Down, Input_Pad_Left, Input_Pad_Right,Input_Pad_C1,Input_Pad_B,Input_Pad_Star,Input_Pad_7,Input_Pad_4,Input_Pad_1,Input_Pad_C2,Input_Pad_C,Input_Pad_0,Input_Pad_8,Input_Pad_5, Input_Pad_2, Input_Pad_C3, Input_Pad_Option, Input_Pad_Sharp, Input_Pad_9, Input_Pad_6,Input_Pad_3. (example: if zero_left_pad band Input_Pad_Star will check left pad for star button press).
- New command added: Input_SetJoyPort1 selects the joypad port 1 to use for rotary/mouse input. This doesn't enable rotary/mouse mode if it isn't already. zero_rotary_delta will give the number of rotary ticks since the last read command.
- New command added: Input_SetJoyPort2 selects the joypad port 2 to use for rotary/mouse input. This doesn't enable rotary/mouse mode if it isn't already.
- New command added: Input_SetRotaryMode selects the rotary mode.
- New command added: Input_SetAtariMouseMode selects the Atari mouse mode. Input_Mouse_Left and Input_Mouse_Right are the masks to check for button presses and zero_mousex_delta, zero_mousey_delta the number of mouse ticks in x and y axis since the last read command.
- New command added: Input_SetAmigaMouseMode selects the Amiga mouse mode.
- New command added: SNDZEROPLAY chan, start_address, len, frequency, params will play a sample starting from start_address with length len to channel chan with speed frequency and with flags params. Channel should be from 1 to 4. start_address should be aligned to 4 bytes. len should be a multiple of 4. frequency should be an integer that divides the base frequency of 46168Hz. So for example if it's set to 1, it'll play a sample at 46168Hz, a 2 will play a sample at 23084Hz etc. Available flags are Zero_Audio_8bit_Signed (plays an 8-bit signed sample), Zero_Audio_8bit_Unsigned (plays an 8-bit unsigned sample), Zero_Audio_8bit_muLaw (plays a 8-bit compressed μLaw sample) and Zero_Audio_Looping (enables sample loop).
- New assets.txt functionality: sfx_mlawFREQ will convert a sample to μlaw and reample it to frequency FREQ (example: sfx_mlaw15389 will convert a sample to 15389Hz and compress it to μLaw ready for the player)
- New assets.txt functionality: sfx_rawFREQ will convert a sample to raw and reample it to frequency FREQ (example: sfx_raw15389 will convert a sample to 15389Hz and compress it to μLaw ready for the player)
- New raptor.o that adds extra functionality:
- New variable exposed: raptor_ntsc_flag is non-zero if machine is ntsc.
- New variable exposed: raptor_user_savedata	points to 512 bytes for user data which will be appended to the MT save
- Slight improvement: you can now use binary bitfields in basic! Just use B8(binary byte) for bytes, B16(binary byte,binary byte) words and B32(binary byte,binary byte,binary byte,binary byte) for longwords!
- Added missing assets.txt from crytest.
- Project starfield added.
- Makelink: CRY conversion for 16 bit images added. assets.txt now accepts "gfx_cry"
- Added new project crytest that demonstrates this.
- Project LOLVALAMP added.

v1.1 - 25 Jul 2015
- Fixed buildlink problem when converting 16-bit images.
- New RAPTOR.O which exposes two new variables: raptor_used_particles and raptor_free_particles, which do pretty much what they say.
- New project "scroller" that has the code that goes with the tutorial of the same name.
- plot() fixed
- RAPTOR_particle_gfx
- Bug fix for TILEMAP
- Raptor variable exposed: raptor_mt_present is negative if no Memory Track is present
- Raptor variable exposed: raptor_highscores_hex points to the highscore table (10 entries, one longword each)
- Raptor variable exposed: raptor_highscores_nam points to the highscore names table (10 entries, 8 characters each, not null terminated)
- New RB+ function hiscore_check(score,name) checks if score is a high score. name, like above, is 8 characters.
- Raptor function exposed: RAPTOR_resort_score_table re-sorts the highscores as well as the names.
- Raptor function exposed: RAPTOR_mt_save saves the highscore table. Use it in combination with present.
- New project added: "scores" which demonstrates all the above

v1.0 - 13 Apr 2015 - initial installer release
