$COMMENT - Comment section added 10/20/2004 05:00AM by Vic McClung
*******************************************************************************
Developer Guidelines
*******************************************************************************
Code should be written in BCX Basic. If it can not be written in BCX Basic for
some reason or results in code that seems too inefficient then this may be a
cue that a new Basic function is needed.

* All KEYWORDS should be capitalized
* Use two space indentation
* Use spaces not tabs
* Record all notes in reverse chronological order
* When adding a runtime function please enclose it as described below:
* The first line of code should be formatted as follows, that is the
* first line should be type name ( param1, parm1, ....)
* for example:
* FPRINT Outfile,"int Eof(FILE* stream)"
* DO NOT split the line!
* second line should only cantain the opening bracket, for example:
* FPRINT Outfile,"{"
* there should be no space between Outfile and the comma and no space
* between the comma and opening double quote, just like the example below:
*

IF Use_Eof THEN
  Add this line--->  IF Use_Library THEN FPRINT Outfile,"// BCXRTLIB: Eof"  <---- name of file used in RTL (Eof.c or Eof.cpp)
  FPRINT Outfile,"int EoF (FILE* stream)"
  FPRINT Outfile,"{"
  FPRINT Outfile,"  register int c, status = ((c = fgetc(stream)) == EOF);"
  FPRINT Outfile,"  ungetc(c,stream);"
  FPRINT Outfile,"  return status;"
  FPRINT Outfile,"}\n\n"
  Add this line--->  IF Use_Library THEN FPRINT Outfile,"// ENDBCXRTLIB "
END IF

* The last line of code in the function should be:
* FPRINT Outfile,"}\n\n"
* When adding a runtime procedure, include in the UseAll subroutine: Use_Eof = TRUE
* This enables creating the runtime library without writing a full-fledged parser to do it. 
* And most importantly....Have fun!

******************************************************************************************
2009/06/02 05:00 GMT-5   Mike Henning
* Changed version to 6.00 as requested by Robert Wishlaw.
* Fixed a naming conflict with the new BCX_Dynacall when used as a return value.

2009/04/27 05:00 GMT-5   Mike Henning
* Merged my changes with Waynes
* New changes include handling of FREE and FREE DYNAMIC.
* DYNAMIC is ignored now relying on free to choose the appropriate method.
* The behavior should be the same now with or without parenthesis.
* Fixed some bugs in the SET statement handling - Variables were not being
* added or recognized properly.
* Fixed the output when using $TRACE
* Some bad code in BCX_PREPARE_COM_TRACE_LINE 
* Added a variation of BCX_DynaCall for easier runtime execution of functions
  not known at compile time.
  BCX_DynaCall("Dll_Name", "Function_Name", NumberOFArgs, ArgArray)

2009/03/12 05:00 GMT-5   Wayne Halsdorf
* Reformatted some of the code
* Added some addition tests for invalid type combinations in COM
* Added additional return types to COM
* Applied Robert Wishlaw's reformating of code

2009/02/12 05:00 GMT-5   Wayne Halsdorf
* Finished correcting all the bugs that I'm aware off in the COM section.
* To DO: 1. Reformat code (anyone up for this)
*        2. Add code to handle all variant types. (much easier to do now)
*        3. Put together a collection of COM examples to serve as a test base.
*        4. Inform Robert as to changes in COM that differ from currently in help file.

2009/01/27 05:00 GMT-5   Wayne Halsdorf
* Start of modification of COM routines to be able to handle arrays of OBJECTs.
* Note: Not every posible combination has been tried.
*       I use a modified version of BCX where I test out various ideas to improve
*       the performance and the expandablity of BCX. This version contains
*       some of those modifications to make it easier to modify changes in
*       the COM routines. Some can be easily added to the current version of BCX. 
* Added internal FUNCTIONS FindWord & GetWordInfo to lookup various words 
*       and return information on type.
*       The function FindWord uses a binary searcg method, with GetWordInfo
*       using a modified version, resulting in a maximum
*       lookup attempts (for x number words) equal to LOG(x)/LOG(2) 
*
2009/01/27 00:00 GMT-5    Mike Henning
* Fixed a bug in the BCX_SETCOLOR function that would cause many color 
  combinations to not show transparent correctly.


2009/01/24 11:00 GMT-7    Kevin Diggins
* Found and removed more unused global variables
* Minor text editing

2009/01/23 05:00 GMT-7    Kevin Diggins
* Found and removed more unused global variables
* Found and removed commented, deprecated code fragments
* Minor text editing and formatting

2009/01/21 05:00 GMT-5    Wayne Halsdorf
* Fixed bug in OPTIONAL (introduced in last fix of OPTIONAL) was adding phantom varible 
* Fixed BCX_SETCOLOR when 3 parameters supplied

2009/01/19 05:00 GMT-7    Kevin Diggins
* Reformatting & general text editing of this document for easier reading
* Removed StkTmp$[] & related dead code
* Removed Xport$ related dead code 
* Removed CObjectTest related dead code
* Removed LinesWritten dead function
* Removed CompStructVars dead function
* Removed Obsolete switches
* Replace FUNCTION BraceCount with new version by Mike Henning


2009/01/16 00:00 GMT-5    Wayne Halsdorf
* Fixed joining of strings detection routine
* 1. handle arrays of structures with string elements - structure[i].string$ , structure[i]->string$
* 2. handle dereference of pointer to structure with string element (*structure).string$
* Fixed bug in OPTIONAL. Example:  a=1 as int  would output wrong code for prototype
* Added code to SET/END SET so that the translator knows what type it is.

01/10/2009 00:00 GMT-5    Mike Henning
* Fixed the Descending dynamic string in qsort
* Added Kevins fixes for the COM functions
* Fixed the handling of the image index for BCX_TOOLBAR
* Removed a couple of function returns that were not needed giving
* "code can not be reached" compiler warnings.
* Added "return" to be sensed when removing dead callback code.
* Increased the buffers in USING$ from 100 to 512

2008/10/08 00:00 GMT-5    Wayne Halsdorf
* Fixed bug introduced in FREE when it was exteneded
* Fixed bug in type detection in CheckGlobal and CheckLocal

2008/10/07 00:00 GMT-5    Wayne Halsorf
* Fixed bug in SWAP when dealing with undefined typed
* Fixed internal bug for getting information from GetTypeInfo when
*   _CLASS is appended to structure type
* Extened usage of DYNAMIC and FREE to include use in structures

2008/08/22 00:00 GMT-5 -  Wayne Halsdorf
* fixed bug in getprocaddress
* fixed on ... goto,gosub,call so that the argument can be of the form (x BAND 7)
* Fixed obscure bug in SplitLines FUNCTION involving parentheses
* SWAP - Changed char to byte for safer swapping based on size
*      - Can now handle dynamic strings
* Rolled chdir, _chdir, rmdir, _rmdir, mkdir, _mkdir into one operation     

2008/07/08 00:00 GMT-8 -  Robert Wishlaw
* Replaced instances of while(1) with for(;;)

2008/07/08 00:00 GMT-8 -  Wayne Halsdorf
* Modified TALLY Function to accept an optional case insensitivity argument.

2008/05/28 19:00 GMT-8 -  Wayne Halsdorf
* Modified CONTAINEDIN Function to work with Borland compiler.

2008/05/26 20:00 GMT-8 -  Wayne Halsdorf
